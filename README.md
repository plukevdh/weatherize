# Slack Weatherizer 

Emoji in Slack usernames is pretty ðŸ‘Œ. But what if we could make it mean something?

Using this small JS script, you can have your profile info reflect the local weather at will using the [Forecast.io](Forecast.io) API.

Slack will append your weather emoji to the `last_name` field in your profile so that it will show up in your Slack client for all to see.

## Setup

There are two obviously possible ways to use this script:

1. Setup to run periodically as an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) timed function.
2. Setup to run as a cron job on a machine with NodeJS installed.

The `Makefile` provided supports Lambda setup.

`make publish` will build the code and publish it to AWS. You will need a number of things before running:

- The [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and authenticated (`aws configure`)/
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- An IAM role capable of running the lambda (AWS provides a `lambda_basic_execution` role which will suffice. You will need the ARN of this rule before running).
- An `.env` file with the following values:
  - FORECASTIO_API_KEY=api-key-from-[forecast-io](https://developer.forecast.io/)
  - LATITUDE=[latitude][1]-of-weather-location
  - LONGITUDE=[longitude][1]-of-weather-location
  - SLACK_TOKEN=[slack-api-token](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens)
  - STATUS_PREFIX=last-name-or-other-text-to-prepend-to-the-weather-emoji

If you want to have multiple Lambda functions (say, for multiple people), you can change the default function name that will be created using the `NAME` paramter. A full make command might look like this: `make publish ROLE=lambda-arn NAME=user-weatherize-profile

You will need to be sure your AWS account user is allowed to create lambdas, events and read/pass IAM roles.

To cron this, you'd just need NodeJS installed and accessible to the cron run user. Then just add a cron job:

1. Run `make setup-cron`. This will give you a cron task definition which you will need to copy.
2. `crontab` will open in 10 seconds so you can paste the value into the crontab. You will probably want to set your `EDITOR` before running (e.g. `EDITOR=vim make setup-cron`).

To uninstall, you can just `crontab -r` or (if you have other jobs) just edit as above and remove the weatherize line added above.
