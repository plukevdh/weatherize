# Slack Weatherizer 

Emoji in Slack usernames is pretty ðŸ‘Œ. But what if we could make it mean something?

Using this small JS script, you can have your profile info reflect the local weather at will using the [Forecast.io](Forecast.io) API.

Slack will append your weather emoji to the `last_name` field in your profile so that it will show up in your Slack client for all to see.

## Setup

You will first need to define a `.env` file with the following values:
  - FORECASTIO_API_KEY=api-key-from-[forecast-io](https://developer.forecast.io/)
  - LATITUDE=[latitude][1]-of-weather-location
  - LONGITUDE=[longitude][1]-of-weather-location
  - SLACK_TOKEN=[slack-api-token](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens)
  - STATUS_PREFIX=last-name-or-other-text-to-prepend-to-the-weather-emoji

You can `cp .env.sample .env` file to get started.

Then setup the dependencies and compile the source: `make build` or, if doing development, `make watch`

There are three obviously possible ways to use this script:

1. Just run it.
2. Setup to run periodically as an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) timed function.
3. Setup to run as a cron job on a machine with NodeJS installed.

The `Makefile` provided support for all three types.

### Just Runâ„¢

`make run` will simpy run the script and set your weather status. Again, remember to setup your `.env` file first.

### AWS Scheduled Lambda 

`make aws-publish` will build the code and publish it to AWS. You will need a number of things before running:

- The [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and authenticated (`aws configure`)/
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- An IAM role capable of running the lambda (AWS provides a `lambda_basic_execution` role which will suffice. You will need the ARN of this rule before running).

If you want to have multiple Lambda functions (say, for multiple people), you can change the default function name that will be created using the `NAME` paramter. A full make command might look like this: `make publish ROLE=lambda-arn NAME=username-weatherize-profile

You will need to be sure your AWS account user is allowed to create lambdas, events and read/pass IAM roles.

If you want to make changes to the code or change your `.env` settings, you will then need to run `make aws-update` to publish the updates to AWS.

If you want to remove all traces of the Lambda and associated events, run `make aws-clean` providing the `NAME` var if you used a custom-named function.

### Sean Cronnery

To cron this, you'd just need NodeJS installed and accessible to the cron run user. Then just add a cron job:

1. Run `make cron-setup`. This will give you a cron task definition which you will need to copy.
2. `crontab` will open in 10 seconds so you can paste the job definition into the crontab file. You will probably want to set your `EDITOR` before running (e.g. `EDITOR=vim make cron-setup`).

To uninstall, you can just `crontab -r` or (if you have other jobs) just edit as above and remove the weatherize line added above.
